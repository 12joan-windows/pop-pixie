# Pop Pixie

Pop Pixie is the successor to our BAFTA-nominated online game, [Mouse Trapped](https://github.com/12joan/mouse_trapped). Like Mouse Trapped, we entered Pop Pixie into the BAFTA Young Game Designers competition. 

The game revolves around the adventures of the Pop Pixie, a vigilante corner shop owner whose mission it is to infiltrate the evil Menotes corporation, discover its secrets and take down the Mentoes' Man. 

## Play online

If you're smart enough to not run executables from developers you don't know, you can play Pop Pixie in your browser on our GitHub Pages site.

## Installing

Because Unity is magic, we can provide builds of Pop Pixie for Linux, Mac and Windows. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/12joan/pop-pixie/releases/latest) for your operating system and have fun!

## Building

Pop Pixie is written in [Unity 2018.3.7](https://unity3d.com/pt/unity/whats-new/2018.3.7). While it's entirely possible that the game will work with a later version, I can't guarantee it. Earlier versions? No chance. 

To play the game, download Unity, download the project, open the project in Unity and click Build and Run. 

## Controls

| Control           | Keyboard and mouse | PS3 Controller |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Move              | WASD or arrow keys | Left joystick  |
| Aim               | Mouse              | Right joystick |
| Shoot             | Left click         | R1             |

The game is designed to be compatible with a PlayStation 3 controller, which you can connect to your device through USB or Bluetooth. I have absolutely no idea what might happen if you try to use an Xbox controller, but it would be fun to find out!

After the project is built, you can change the input settings using the Input tab in the launch window.
