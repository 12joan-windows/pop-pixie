I just wanted to let you know about something that not many people will have considered. \n\nThe term 'savage'--\n\nDon't use it. \n\nIt's a racial slur used against Native Americans[1] to dehumanise them, implying that they're uncivilised. Even though the word has other meanings nowadays, which aren't inherently harmful, it would be better for everyone if the word just fell out of everyday vocabulary. \n\nDon't blame yourself if you didn't know that; I had no idea until someone told me. Just try to avoid using the word entirely, as a racial slur or otherwise. If you overhear someone else using the word, then politely inform them of the harmful connotations. \n\nThat's all I have to say for now. Since I was doing this whole \"making a video game\" thing, I thought it would be nice to use this as a medium for getting the point across to as many people as possible. \n\nYou can go back to being a hero now. :-)\n\n- [1] http://www.rsdb.org/slur/savage"
